# Module 3: Type Enforcement

In this module, students will build upon their previous implementation of the stack machine in Module 2 to add in typing enforcement. As expressions are evaluated...

## Your Task
**TO-DO: Implementation of a more robust typing system in the source code must be completed before this module can be documented.**

### Testing

The following test should run to completion:

```bash
> dfx start --background
> dfx canister create --all
> dfx build
Building canisters...

> dfx canister install --all
"StackMachine" canister created with canister id: "ic:..."
"Test" canister created with canister id: "ic:..."
...

> dfx canister call Test run
()
```
